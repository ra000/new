<p><img src="images/look.jpg">Shutterstock was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneur and computer programmer Jon Oringer.[18] Creating his own online marketplace,[4] Oringer initially uploaded 30,000 of his own stock photos and made them available via subscription,[4] with unlimited downloads and a monthly starting fee of USD $49.[4] When demand exceeded his photo supply,[4] he became an agent[19] and began hiring additional contributors.[4] Helping pioneer the subscription based microstock photography business model,[19] Shutterstock claimed that it was the "largest subscription-based stock photo agency in the world" as of 2006, with 570,000 images in its collection.[20] Shutterstock branched into film in 2006 with the launch of Shutterstock Footage,[20] and by 2007, the company had 1.8 million photos.[8] Insight Venture Partners invested in the company that year.[4] Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in August 2008, with its "On Demand" service removing daily download limits.[9]

On September 23, 2009, Shutterstock announced that it had purchased Bigstock, a rival credit-based microstock photography agency.[12] Fast Company argued the deal put "Shutterstock on a competitive playing field with Getty, whose iStockPhoto is also credit-based."[21] Shutterstock's CEO Jon Oringer stated the addition would "enable Shutterstock to better satisfy the diverse payment preferences of stock photo buyers worldwide."[12] Shutterstock had 11 million royalty-free stock images by early 2010.[22] In February 2011, Shutterstock announced a two-year partnership with the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) to provide creative inspiration to its members.[23] Claiming it licensed more images than "any other brand worldwide" in 2011,[23] that November Shutterstock debuted Shutterstock for iPad, which it provided for free</p>

<p><img src="images/valley.jpg">Shutterstock has developed a number of tools utilizing a "convolutional neural network" that it created[17] to help with reverse image search technology.[50] The network is "essentially a computer system that is trained to recognize images - there are millions of specific items such as cats, bicycles, the night sky - and pull up the most relevant photos."[17] The network was dubbed computer vision by Shutterstock, and it "breaks down the key components of a photo numerically, drawing from its pixel data instead of metadata that is pulled from those tags and keywords."[17]

"So a lot of image databases fill in those gaps with user behavior. If people searching the words 'bike' and 'fence' download a particular image more often, that one probably contains those two things in it.... Computer vision [like Shutterstock's] can change all that by eliminating the need for keywords in the first place. Using a series of algorithms, a model can progressively survey each pixel in an image to pick out different features in it—the color, the shapes, the sharpness of the angles. Each calculation is a layer of the deep learning network."

On March 10, 2016, Shutterstock debuted its Reverse Image Search tool. According to Entrepreneur, with the tool "users can upload an image, either from Shutterstock or another source, and the tool will call up images that look like and have a similar feel to the original photo."[17] The reverse image search allows users to not just search by keywords, but to also find images based on "color schemes, mood, or shapes."[50] Later that month, Shutterstock also debuted its Similar Search and Discovery tools,[17] with the "similar search" option provided beneath photos on the Shutterstock website</p>
